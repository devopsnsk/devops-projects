# **Day7: Docker Compose & Git Branch Practice**

## **Description**
On **Day 7**, I practiced **Docker Compose**, a tool to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. The project includes:

1. **Web (NGINX)** â€“ Serves a simple HTML page.
2. **Redis** â€“ Lightweight in-memory database.

I ran the containers using `docker compose up -d` and verified both services with `docker ps`. The NGINX service was accessed in a browser at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

Additionally, I practiced **Git branch workflow**:
- Created a feature branch `day7-feature`
- Committed Docker Compose files, HTML page, and proof screenshots
- Pushed branch to GitHub
- Created a Pull Request and merged it into `main`
